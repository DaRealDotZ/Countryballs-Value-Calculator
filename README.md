When you're asked to submit the rank, you should submit the rarity of the ball as shown on the ballsdex wiki: https://ballsdex.miraheze.org/wiki/Rarity_List
the "atk % bonus" and "helath % bonus" are both self explanitory. Just submit the percentage bonus of each stat when asked.
If your ball is shiny, submit "true" when asked. Otherwise you should submit "false".
The seasonal functionality is coming soon.
